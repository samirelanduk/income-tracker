# Finances App

An app for tracking personal income, mostly from companies the individual controls.
It is mostly used for calculating tax returns.

## data.js

A transaction is any payment from a company to personal, or vice versa.
It is made up of components to specify what makes up that transaction.
For example, a payment might be partly dividend, partly salary.

## Loans

The app will calculate how much a company owes you or is owed, by taking the net of all money in and out, and subtracting payments to you specified as dividends/salary etc.
